# Mean-Reverting Portfolio Modeling

This project focuses on modeling a given portfolio as a mean-reverting stochastic process and computing a few quantities that could aid in decision-making. The code can be found in [main.ipynb](src/main.ipynb). 

Note that running this notebook requires the installation of several Python packages. To install them, make sure to have both Python (e.g., version 3.12.3) and `pip` installed, and run the following command in a terminal from the root directory of this project:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
